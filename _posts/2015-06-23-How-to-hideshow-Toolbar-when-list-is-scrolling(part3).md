This is a third (and the really last) post of this series :) If you haven't read [part 1] or [part 2] that's ok because they are deprecated now. In previous parts I showed how to manually achieve hiding/showing Toolbar when list is scrolling. But now we have the [Design Support Library] and we don't have to write it on our own! I will show how to use [CoordinatorLayout] and create a simple [Behavior] to hide/show Toolbar and FAB when list scrolls up/down. Many of you had a problem with tabs and lists that contain too few items to scroll. I'm happy to tell you that thanks to [CoordinatorLayout] all these problems are gone :) Let's begin!

This is what we want to achieve:

## Preparation
In order to use the new cool features that [Design Support Library] has to offer we need to modify our `build.gradle` file:
{% gist /mzgreen/233f4f7da7142a0e3fc2 %}

It's just updated SDK, build tools and libraries to the newest version. And as you can see there is also a new one at the end `compile 'com.android.support:design:22.2.0'`.

Now we can create our `PartThreeActivity` and fill it with some data. Our demo will have 2 tabs with lists of items on each tab. So we'll need a `ViewPager` which will be showing two `Fragments`. In our case both `Fragments` will display a list of items, so they will be the same. The only difference is that we will show 20 items on first page and only 5 items on second page. This is because I want to show you that even if list is too short to scroll we will be able to show/hide the `Toolbar` and FAB. So let's start from creating a `PartThreeFragment` class.
Here is it's layout file:
{% gist /mzgreen/fd6e50f3391f6eddf56c %}

Nothing special here, just a `RecyclerView`. Let's jump to `PartThreeFragment` code:
{% gist /mzgreen/2ad432f2097b151cf0cd %}

It's an ordinary `Fragment` so I won't describe it. The only interesting part is that we can give it a number of items that our list will contain (look at `createInstance(int itemsCount)` and `createItemList()` methods). `RecyclerAdapter` and the layout of a single list item is exactly the same as we created in [part 2].

So we have it, now we need to setup our `PartThreeActivity`. Let's look at the layout file:
{% gist /mzgreen/aeb61d9a4d9cb0e079a1 %}

Let's stop a little bit. There are a few new things in there. First is the [CoordinatorLayout]. It's a new layout that let's you create interactions between `Views` that you put inside it. As the documentation says it's a `FrameLayout` on steroids. It intercepts touch events and let's you inject your own [Behaviors]. We'll see an example of this a little bit later. Next new thing is the [AppBarLayout]. It's an enhanced version of `Linearlayout` that allows you to specify scrolling interactions. You can for example create a collapsing `Toolbar` effect or some other things with it. It's as simple as puttng it into your layout and setting some attributes. But it's designed to work in pair with `CoordinatorLayout` so if you use it in some other `ViewGroup` you will loose it's functionality. The last new thing that you can see here is the `TabLayout` which i think is self-explanatory. It's basically a new material version of tabs for Android. In our case we want to have the `Tabs` below the `Toolbar` so we wrap them in an `AppBarLayout`. The last part of our layout is a `ViewPager`. Let's glue it all together using some Java code:
{% gist /mzgreen/65a3ae848d8fb756a65f %}

The only interesting fragment of this class is `ViewPager` and `TabLayout` initialization which you can see above. `PagerAdapter` is a simple implementation of `FragmentPagerAdapter` so I assume that you are familiar with it. In lines 4 and 5 we are adding two pages to our adapter. First page will contain our `PartThreeFragment` with 20 items and second page will contain the same `Fragment` but with only 5 items.

We can now compile it and see how it looks like:
![Cut top](/images/3/screencuttop.png "Cut top")

It works but as you can see, the top of the list is not fully visible. It seems that it's partially covered by our `AppBarLayout`. To fix this we need to add a `Behavior` to a `ViewPager`. It looks like this:
{% gist /mzgreen/cb75d3f8bf665d6c4725 %}

This string value points to `android.support.design.widget.AppBarLayout$ScrollingViewBehavior` so it's a fully qualifed [Behavior] class name. It's a static inner class inside `AppBarLayout` class. `Behavior` is a mechanism that let's you specify interactions between the `Views` that you put inside a `CoordinatorLayout`. The `CoordinatorLayout` parses `Behaviors` and handles interactions between `Views`. Thanks to the fact that you can add it using xml attribute allows adding a `Behavior` to any `View`. This is a very powerful API and I really encourage you to play with it. In our case adding `ScrollingViewBehavior` to the `ViewPager` causes that it will be positioned correctly according to `AppBarLayout` and its position will be updated as `AppBarLayout` scrolls. The new [Design Support Library] source is not available yet but you can use Android Studio built in decompiler to see what exactly `ScrollingViewBehavior` is doing.
If we run our app now we should see something like this:
![Working tabs and list](/images/3/onlytabs.gif "Working tabs and list")

It looks ok, so we can move on.

##Scrolling Toolbar and FloatingActionButton

Now it's time to make our Toolbar scrollable. If you have seen two previous parts of this post you're probably thinking that we will be creating another `OnScrollListener` or something. But it's not the case. Actually we need to add only one line of code to out layout file:
{% gist /mzgreen/fb0a56c98ee777d9e27f %}

And that's it! The `app:layout_scrollFlags="scroll|enterAlways"` line will cause that our `Toolbar` will scroll of the screen when user scrolls down the list and as soon as he starts scrolling up the `Toolbar` will show up again. Clean and simple, that's the power of `CoordinatorLayout`!

The app now looks like this:
![Scrolling toolbar](/images/3/scrollingtoolbar.gif "Scrolling toolbar")

As you can see if you scroll the `Toolbar` off the screen and change tabs, it remains scrolled off. And even that on the second page we have only 5 items, so list itself cannot be scrolled, you can still show the `Toolbar`. The `CoordinatorLayout` makes it possible.

So the last part is adding a FAB. In [part 1] we had to create it manually. We were using an `ImageButton` with a circular drawable as a background. From now on we have a `FloatingActionButton` widget in the [Design Support Library]! Let's add it to our `activity_part_three.xml` layout file:
{% gist /mzgreen/7119c87149c6d7a2ccfc %}

There are some known issues with FAB and other widgets from [Design Support Library] but most of them are already fixed so all we have to do is to wait for the release of the updated version. More on using new FAB widget you can read on [Antonio's blog]. Our app now have a `FloatingActionButton`:
![App with fab](/images/3/screenwithfab.png "App with fab")

But if we start scrolling, the FAB stays in place and only the `Toolbar` is moving. To address this issue we will create a custom `Behavior` for our FAB. Let's look at the code:
{% gist /mzgreen/7b77aa4ec95f81c3bed0 %}

It's not a lot of code as you can see. Let's look at the important parts. First we extend from `CoordinatorLayout.Behavior` class. Note that we have to override constructor taking `Context` and `AttributeSet` as parameters in order to use this `Behavior` in our layout (xml) files.  Next method that we need to override is `layoutDependsOn`. This method tells `CoordinatorLayout` that we want our FAB to depend on `AppBarLayout`. So from now on we will be notified about changes of an `AppBarLayout` size or position. To receive this notification we have to override another method which is `onDependentViewChanged`. In this method we are calculating how much of the `AppBarLayout` is scrolled off the screen and we are scrolling our FAB accordingly. So if a half of our `AppBarLayout` is scrolled off then a half of FAB should also be scrolled off. That's basically it. Calculating ratio and moving FAB. We return `true` from this method because it changes position of child view (FAB in our case). What we need to do right now is to add this behavior to our FAB. Let's do it then:
{% gist /mzgreen/2002e3dd979e22f47cf1 %}

As you can see we are using fully qualified name of our `Behavior` class.

Let's see how it works:
![Working example gif](/images/3/scrollingtoolbarandfab.gif "Working example gif")

Great, now the FAB moves with our `Toolbar`!



As you can see the new [Design Support Library] is really powerful. Using it is pretty simple but it takes some time to get used to new stuff. I again encourage you to play with it and see what else you can do. `Behaviors` are very flexible and there is a lot more methods available in there. As I have said there are still some rough edges. For example the `Toolbar` is not snapping to the position, there is some issue with `Overscroll` which shows when you fling up but not when you scroll up etc. Most of these issues has status `FutureRelease` so we will get the fixes soon :)
